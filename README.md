🚀 ProofMe Protocol – Web3 Identity & Content Authentication System
🔍 What is ProofMe?
ProofMe is a decentralized verification protocol designed to protect people’s identity and content in a world full of digital manipulation.

It allows users to prove the authenticity of their images, videos, documents, and certificates by generating a unique content fingerprint (hash) and linking it to their identity using Web3 wallets and the Internet Computer (ICP) blockchain.

Our vision is to give people full control over their digital truth — whether you're an artist, student, journalist, or everyday user… you can finally say:

✅ “Yes, this content is mine — and here's the proof on-chain.”

💡 Why ProofMe?
In an age where AI can fake your voice, face, and even behavior, misinformation and digital impersonation have become dangerous tools.

A deepfake video can ruin someone’s life.

A fake certificate can get someone a job they don’t deserve.

A stolen artwork can go viral without credit.

ProofMe was created to stop this.

🧠 How It Works (Tech Overview)
The protocol integrates with any platform (like social media or educational portals) and follows this flow:

User uploads content (video/image/document) on a ProofMe-enabled platform.

If it’s personal media, the user must record a real-time selfie video to verify their identity.

We generate a hash/fingerprint of the content.

The hash + identity are stored immutably on the ICP blockchain.

Anyone viewing the content can instantly verify if it’s authentic and published by the rightful owner — or not.

🔧 Tech Stack
Layer	Technology Used
Frontend	Next.js (for uploading content + UI)
Hashing Engine	SHA-256 or equivalent hash algorithms
Smart Contracts	Motoko on ICP
Identity Layer	ICP Identity + Web3 Wallet integration
API Integration	ICP Canister APIs for content verification

📦 Current Status
This is a first draft and early prototype of the ProofMe protocol.
The code is currently being explored and built step by step, focusing on:

Structuring the content upload & hash logic

Writing ICP smart contracts with Motoko

Integrating DID and Web3 authentication

Designing the architecture for verifier modules

🚧 Please note:
This repository is intended for demonstration and submission purposes only at this stage. Code may be incomplete, experimental, or non-functional in some areas.

📌 Future Scope
We aim to expand ProofMe to support:

Artist & designer content ownership

Certificate & license validation

Anti-deepfake media checking

Educational proof & participation logs

Cross-platform API integration for social networks

🙏 Special Thanks
Thanks to the WCHL Hackathon organizers and ICP Hub Egypt for this opportunity.
We’re excited to turn ProofMe from an idea into a global standard for digital truth.
